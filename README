Cryptfire2 - udpate of cryptfire 1.0 firefox plugin
javascript tools to support encryption in the browser
the heavy lifting crypto stuff is done by javascrypt

planned things to do (from concrete to mushy)
- make it install to latest version of firefox (3.6.x) - done
- remove the dependency on the cryptfire.com website which doesn't exist anymore
- fully test functionality and remove/fix what doesn't work
- fix it so encrypting or decrypting something doesn't overwrite your clipboard
- add a retype-password option when encrypting to make sure you entered the password you wanted
- think about using other encryption keys - keyfile, smartcards, etc.
- think about UI-type ways to make it better
- who knows what else...
